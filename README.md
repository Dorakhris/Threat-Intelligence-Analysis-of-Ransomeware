# Project Title
Threat Intelligence Profile: A Deep-Dive on the DarkSide Ransomware Group


## Case Summary
- **Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive threat intelligence analysis of the DarkSide ransomware group. The investigation began with a practical detection exercise and expanded to create a full actor profile, map their operational playbook to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and develop strategic defense recommendations.
- **Scope:** The analysis pivoted from a single confirmed DarkSide malware sample (identified from a larger dataset) to a broad investigation using open-source intelligence (OSINT).
- **Tools Used:** Python (for VirusTotal API scripting), VirusTotal, MITRE ATT&CK Framework, YARA, various OSINT sources.
- **Outcome:** I successfully profiled the DarkSide RaaS group, detailed their TTPs, and created a custom YARA rule for proactive hunting. The final deliverable was a set of actionable mitigation strategies aligned with the NIST and ISO 27001 frameworks.


## Tools & Environment
| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3** | Scripting language used to automate the query of 30+ file hashes against the VirusTotal API. |
| **VirusTotal API** | The primary tool for the initial triage and identification of the malicious DarkSide sample. |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** | The analytical framework I used to structure and map the actor's observed TTPs. |
| **YARA** | Used to create a custom signature for detecting DarkSide samples based on my analysis. |
| **OSINT Sources** | CISA advisories, security vendor blogs (e.g., Mandiant, CrowdStrike), and news articles. |
| **OS/VM Used** | Windows 11 with WSL for Python scripting and analysis. |


## Case Background
This project began not as a purely academic exercise, but with a practical challenge. I was presented with a list of 31 unvetted file hashes and was tasked with rapidly identifying any high-priority threats among them. To accomplish this efficiently, I developed a Python script to programmatically query the VirusTotal API. One of the hashes returned a definitive match for the DarkSide ransomware. This single, high-confidence indicator became the pivot point for a much deeper intelligence investigation into the group responsible for one of the most disruptive cyberattacks in recent history.


## Methodology
My investigation followed the intelligence lifecycle, moving from raw data collection to refined, actionable intelligence.

1.  **Automated Triage:** I wrote and executed a Python script to iterate through the list of file hashes, submitting each one to the VirusTotal API to gather existing analysis and community sourcing data.
2.  **Indicator Confirmation:** The script flagged one hash as a known DarkSide sample. I manually verified this result using OSINT to confirm its authenticity and gather initial context.
3.  **Intelligence Gathering (OSINT):** I conducted a deep-dive investigation, systematically collecting and collating information on DarkSide from trusted sources, including CISA alerts, threat reports from leading security firms, and technical analyses of the Colonial Pipeline incident.
4.  **TTP Mapping:** I synthesized the collected intelligence, deconstructed DarkSide's operational methods, and mapped each step of their attack chain to the corresponding Tactic and Technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
5.  **Signature Development:** Based on the common characteristics and strings found in DarkSide samples, I authored a YARA rule to enable proactive hunting for their malware.
6.  **Strategic Analysis:** I translated the technical TTPs into business risks and formulated a set of high-level mitigation strategies, aligning them with established security frameworks (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001) to make them actionable for leadership.


## Findings & Evidence
The investigation produced a detailed profile of a sophisticated and organized cybercriminal enterprise.

**Threat Actor Profile**
| Attribute | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actor Type** | Organized Crime, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Operator |
| **Origin** | Suspected Russian or Eastern European (historically avoided CIS targets) |
| **Primary Motivation** | Financial Gain via Double Extortion (encryption + data leak threat) |
| **Notable Targets** | Colonial Pipeline, Toshiba, CompuCom |

**Operational TTPs Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK**
| MITRE Tactic | Technique (ID) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Access** | Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001) | The group exploits vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems like VPNs or uses stolen credentials to gain RDP access. |
| **Execution** | PowerShell (T1059.001) | They leverage PowerShell extensively for "living-off-the-land" execution, helping to evade simple defenses. |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Credential Dumping: Mimikatz (T1003.001) | DarkSide uses tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials from memory to escalate privileges to Domain Administrator. |
| **Defense Evasion** | Inhibit System Recovery (T1490) | They deliberately delete Volume Shadow Copies to prevent easy restoration of encrypted files. |
| **Lateral Movement** | Remote Services: PSExec (T1570) | The group uses legitimate admin tools like PSExec to move across the network and deploy the ransomware payload widely. |
| **Command & Control** | Application Layer Protocol: Cobalt Strike (T1071) | Cobalt Strike is their C2 framework of choice, often communicating over standard ports like TCP/443 to blend in. |
| **Exfiltration** | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) | For their double extortion tactic, they steal sensitive data using their C2 channel before deploying the ransomware. |
| **Impact** | Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486) | The final stage, where files are encrypted (Salsa20/ChaCha20) and the ransom note is dropped. |


##  Logs
Below is the YARA rule I developed for detecting DarkSide ransomware samples. It focuses on unique strings found in the malware's code and its ransom notes.

*YARA Rule for Detection:*
```yara
rule DarkSide_Ransomware_Detector
{
    meta:
        author = "Dorathy Christopher"
        description = "Detects DarkSide ransomware based on common strings and file structure."
        date = "2023-10-27"
        reference_hash = "156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673"

    strings:
        $s1 = "DarkSide"
        $s2 = ".darkside"
        $s3 = "README.darkside.txt"
        $s4 = { 57 65 6c 63 6f 6d 65 20 74 6f 20 74 68 65 20 64 61 72 6b 20 73 69 64 65 } // "Welcome to the dark side" in hex

    condition:
        // Ensures the file is a Windows PE and contains at least two of the indicator strings
        uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and 2 of them
}
```



## Conclusion
DarkSide operates as a highly capable and financially motivated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group. Their well-defined operational playbook, which leverages legitimate system tools and established attack frameworks like Cobalt Strike, makes them a formidable threat.

**Impact:** A successful DarkSide attack results in severe business disruption due to data encryption and significant reputational and financial damage from the threat of data leakage (double extortion). The Colonial Pipeline incident underscored the potential for these attacks to impact critical national infrastructure.

**Recommendations:** To defend against DarkSide and similar advanced threats, I recommend prioritizing the following controls, which are aligned with industry-best-practice frameworks.

| Recommendation | Business Impact | Framework Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Prevents unauthorized RDP/VPN access, neutralizing DarkSide's primary initial access vector. | **NIST 800-53:** IA-2 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.9.4.3 |
| **Implement Robust Patch Management** | Closes the vulnerabilities in public-facing applications that the group actively exploits. | **NIST 800-53:** SI-2 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.12.6.1 |
| **Maintain Segregated & Offline Backups** | Provides a reliable recovery path, making the organization resilient to the "encryption for impact" stage and removing the need to pay a ransom. | **NIST 800-53:** CP-9 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.12.3.1 |
| **Deploy Network Segmentation** | Limits the attacker's ability to move laterally, containing a breach and minimizing the overall blast radius of an attack. | **NIST 800-53:** SC-7 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.13.1.3 |


## Lessons Learned / Reflection
This project powerfully demonstrated the link between a single, low-level indicator (a file hash) and high-level, strategic threat intelligence. It's a clear example of how technical skills, like scripting with an API, can serve as the foundation for broader geopolitical and business risk analysis. The most critical lesson was understanding the *actor* behind the malware. By profiling their TTPs, motivations, and common targets, defensive strategies become much more targeted and effective.

If I were to expand on this project, I would build out a more robust threat intelligence platform, automatically ingesting data from multiple feeds (not just VirusTotal) and using machine learning to identify patterns in TTPs across different threat actor groups.
