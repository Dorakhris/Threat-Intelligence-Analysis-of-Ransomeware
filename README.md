# Threat Intelligence Analysis of Ransomeware

## Overview
This project analyzes 31 SHA-256 hashes to identify and mitigate DarkSide ransomware, a high-profile threat known for attacks like Colonial Pipeline (2021). Using a Python script to query VirusTotal, I identified a malicious hash, created a YARA rule for detection, and documented the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with MITRE ATT&CK mappings. Recommendations align with NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and CIS/MITRE best practices, showcasing my skills in Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Security Operations Center (SOC), and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).


## Executive Summary
This Threat Intelligence analysis identified a DarkSide ransomware hash among 31 SHA-256 values, using a Python script to query VirusTotal. The hash (156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673) was flagged by 63/73 vendors as malicious. I created a YARA rule for detection and documented DarkSide’s TTPs, including RDP abuse and Cobalt Strike usage, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1190, T1486). Recommendations include MFA, patch management, and network segmentation, aligned with NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001, to mitigate future risks.

## Methodology

- Developed a Python script to query VirusTotal’s API, automating analysis of 31 SHA-256 hashes.
- Identified the malicious hash and extracted details (e.g., malware name, vendor detections).
- Created a YARA rule to detect DarkSide ransomware samples.
- Researched DarkSide’s history, notable attacks, and TTPs using OSINT (e.g., VirusTotal, public reports).

## Findings

**Malicious Hash**: 156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673

**Malware Name**: DarkSide ransomware

**VirusTotal Result**: 63/73 security vendors flagged as malicious

**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)

## Threat Intelligence Research
### Malware History
DarkSide ransomware, emerging in August 2020, encrypts files and demands cryptocurrency ransoms. Its May 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack caused a U.S. fuel shortage, netting over $4 million. Other targets include Toshiba Tec (740GB stolen), Brenntag ($4.4 million ransom), and CompuCom (service outages).

### Threat Actor
The DarkSide Hacker Group, likely Russian or Eastern European, operates as a for-profit Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). Possible ties to FIN7 exist, based on TTP similarities, but no confirmed attribution.

### Motivation and Tactics

**Motivation**: Financial extortion via double extortion (encryption and data leak threats).

**Tactics**:
- Initial Access: RDP abuse, phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities (MITRE ATT&CK T1190).
- Command and Control: RDP over Tor port 443, Cobalt Strike (T1071).
- Privilege Escalation: Credential theft via Mimikatz (T1003).
- Defense Evasion: Deletes shadow copies, stops logging (T1562).
- Lateral Movement: PSExec, RDP for network spread (T1021).
- Exfiltration: 7-Zip, Rclone to Mega/PrivatLab (T1567).
- Impact: Encrypts files with Salsa20 (Windows) or ChaCha20 (Linux) after exfiltration (T1486).


### Attack Lifecycle

- Initial Access: Phishing, RDP abuse, or exploits (e.g., VPN vulnerabilities) using Metasploit, PowerShell.
- Lateral Movement: Compromises Domain Controller via BloodHound, PSExec (T1021).
- Exfiltration: Transfers data with Rclone, 7-Zip to cloud storage (T1567).
- Execution: Deploys ransomware via PowerShell, Certutil (T1105), encrypting files and deleting shadow copies.

### YARA Rule Creation
A YARA rule was created to detect DarkSide ransomware based on its binary patterns:

_**rule DarkSide_Ransomware {
   
    meta:
    
        description = "Detects DarkSide ransomware based on binary patterns"
        
        author = "Dorathy Christopher"
        
        date = "2025-03-26"
    
    strings:
    
        $s1 = "DarkSide" ascii
        
        $s2 = ".darkside" ascii
        
        $s3 = "README.darkside.txt" ascii
    
    condition:
    
        uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and 2 of ($s*)

}**_

**Tested**: Rule successfully flagged the malicious hash in a lab environment.

### Detection and Prevention Strategies

- Implement frequent data backups with offsite storage to minimize ransomware impact (NIST 800-53 CP-9).
- Deploy antivirus/anti-malware, IPS, and network segmentation informed by Threat Intelligence (ISO 27001 A.12.4.1).
- Enforce patch management to close vulnerabilities (NIST 800-53 SI-2).
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure RDP/VPN access (NIST 800-53 IA-2).
- Use email filters to block phishing payloads (ISO 27001 A.12.2.1).
- Block malicious IPs and Tor exit nodes using firewall rules (NIST 800-53 SC-7).
- Conduct awareness training to recognize phishing and social engineering (ISO 27001 A.7.2.2).
- Adopt CIS/MITRE best practices for proactive defense (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK framework).

## Conclusion
This analysis underscores DarkSide ransomware’s threat to critical infrastructure, emphasizing the need for proactive Threat Intelligence, robust detection, and compliance-aligned mitigations. By leveraging Python, VirusTotal, and YARA, I identified and mitigated a malicious hash, contributing to organizational resilience.
