# Threat Intelligence Report: Profiling the DarkSide Ransomware Group

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive threat intelligence profile on the **DarkSide ransomware group**, a significant threat actor known for high-impact attacks like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline incident.

The investigation began with a practical detection exercise: using a custom Python script to query the VirusTotal API, I successfully identified a DarkSide ransomware sample among a batch of 31 file hashes. This initial indicator served as a pivot point for a deep-dive analysis into the group's history, motivations, and operational playbook.

The key deliverable of this analysis is a complete threat profile, including a detailed mapping of the actor's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, a custom YARA rule for proactive hunting, and a set of strategic mitigation recommendations aligned with **NIST 800-53** and **ISO 27001** controls.

This project showcases an end-to-end intelligence lifecycle: from automated data analysis and threat identification to strategic defense planning.

## Threat Actor Profile: DarkSide
| Attribute | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actor Type** | Organized Crime, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Operator |
| **Origin** | Suspected Russian or Eastern European (avoids CIS targets) |
| **Primary Motivation** | Financial Gain via Extortion |
| **Key Tactic** | Double Extortion (Encrypting data and threatening to leak stolen data) |
| **Notable Targets** | Colonial Pipeline, Toshiba, Brenntag, CompuCom |

## Technical Analysis: MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
Based on open-source intelligence (OSINT) and analysis of the sample, I have mapped DarkSide's operational TTPs to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

| MITRE Tactic | Technique (ID) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Access** | Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001) | Exploiting vulnerabilities in VPNs or other edge devices; brute-forcing or using stolen credentials for RDP access. |
| **Execution** | PowerShell (T1059.001), Certutil (T1105) | Using legitimate system tools to execute malicious commands and download payloads, evading simple detection. |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Credential Dumping: Mimikatz (T1003.001) | Stealing credentials from memory to escalate privileges, often targeting Domain Admin accounts. |
| **Defense Evasion** | Inhibit System Recovery (T1490), Impair Defenses (T1562) | Deleting Volume Shadow Copies to prevent system restoration; stopping security services and logging. |
| **Lateral Movement** | Remote Services: PSExec (T1570) | Using administrative tools like PSExec to move across the network and deploy ransomware to other systems. |
| **Command & Control** | Application Layer Protocol: Cobalt Strike (T1071) | Leveraging the Cobalt Strike framework for persistent C2 communication, often tunneled over common ports (e.g., 443). |
| **Exfiltration** | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041), Archive via Utility (T1560.001) | Stealing sensitive data using tools like Rclone or 7-Zip and sending it to actor-controlled cloud storage. |
| **Impact** | Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486) | The final stage, where data is encrypted using Salsa20/ChaCha20 and a ransom note is deployed. |

## Detection & Hunting
To enable proactive detection of DarkSide ransomware, I developed the following YARA rule. It was tested and successfully flagged the malicious sample in a lab environment.

```yara
rule DarkSide_Ransomware_Detector
{
    meta:
        author = "Dorathy Christopher"
        description = "Detects DarkSide ransomware based on common strings and file structure."
        date = "2023-10-27"
        reference_hash = "156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673"

    strings:
        $s1 = "DarkSide" ascii wide
        $s2 = ".darkside" ascii wide
        $s3 = "README.darkside.txt" ascii wide
        $s4 = { 57 65 6c 63 6f 6d 65 20 74 6f 20 74 68 65 20 64 61 72 6b 20 73 69 64 65 } // "Welcome to the dark side"

    condition:
        // Is a Windows PE file and contains at least two of the indicator strings
        uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and 2 of them
}
```

## Mitigation & GRC Alignment
The following strategic recommendations are designed to mitigate the risks posed by DarkSide and similar threats. Each recommendation is aligned with established security frameworks to bridge the gap between technical controls and compliance requirements.

| Recommendation | Business Impact | Framework Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Prevents unauthorized RDP/VPN access even with stolen credentials, neutralizing a key initial access vector. | **NIST 800-53:** IA-2 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.9.4.3 |
| **Implement a Robust Patch Management Program** | Systematically closes vulnerabilities that DarkSide exploits for initial access, reducing the organization's attack surface. | **NIST 800-53:** SI-2 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.12.6.1 |
| **Maintain Segregated & Offline Backups** | Ensures data can be restored without paying a ransom, minimizing business disruption and financial loss from an attack. | **NIST 800-53:** CP-9 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.12.3.1 |
| **Deploy Network Segmentation** | Limits an attacker's ability to move laterally across the network, containing a breach to a smaller segment. | **NIST 800-53:** SC-7 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.13.1.3 |
| **Conduct Regular User Awareness Training** | Equips employees to recognize and report phishing attempts, strengthening the human firewall against social engineering tactics. | **NIST 800-53:** AT-2 <br> **ISO 27001:** A.7.2.2 |
